# addAccessRule.py
# version 1.0
#
#
# This example demonstrates communication with Check Point Management server using Management API Library in Python.
# The demonstrated commands are:
#
#   1. login
#   2. adding an access rule to the top of Network layer
#   3. publishing the changes
#
# Logout command is called automatically after the work with Management API Library is completed.
